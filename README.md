# Mini Canvas App - Circle Movement (Kotlin)
This is a simple Android app developed in Kotlin that allows users to draw a circle on a canvas and move it in four directions (up, down, left, right) using buttons.

## Features
Canvas: A custom view (using Android's Canvas class) where a circle is drawn. 🟠
Circle Movement: Use the following buttons to move the circle:
Up ⬆️: Moves the circle upwards.
Down ⬇️: Moves the circle downwards.
Left ⬅️: Moves the circle to the left.
Right ➡️: Moves the circle to the right.
Real-time Updates: The circle's position updates immediately when you press a button.

## App Structure
Canvas View: A custom view for drawing and updating the circle.
Buttons: Four directional buttons to control the circle's movement.

## Screen Layout
The app’s interface consists of:

Canvas: A large central area where the circle is displayed. 🟠
Directional Buttons: Four buttons (⬆️, ⬇️, ⬅️, ➡️) placed below or around the canvas, allowing the user to control the movement of the circle.
App Icon 🎨
The app uses a simple icon to represent its function:

A blue circle on a white background, symbolizing the movable circle on the canvas. 🟦⚪
The icon reflects the core functionality of the app, allowing users to interact with the circle and move it in all directions.
Note: You can set this app icon in the res/drawable directory of your project and configure it in the Android manifest file (AndroidManifest.xml).

## How to Use
Install the app on your Android device or emulator.
Launch the app — you’ll see a canvas with a circle in the center. 🟠
Use the directional buttons (⬆️, ⬇️, ⬅️, ➡️) to move the circle around the canvas.
Technologies Used
Kotlin: The programming language used for Android development.
Android SDK: Tools and libraries for building the app’s UI and handling user interactions.
